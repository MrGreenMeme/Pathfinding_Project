## Results

### Overview
The results presented in the [table](results/results.csv) represent the average values obtained from 10 independent runs of each algorithm on a specific map configuration.
This method reduces variance, leading to more reliable and robust results.

### Test Environment
All tests were conducted on the following setup:
```
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690 CPU @ 3.50GHz (4 cores, 4 threads)
RAM: 16 GB DDR3 @ 1333 MHz
